      q: "Do you offer co-managed IT?",
      a: "Yes. We can share tools, SOPs, escalations, and reporting with your internal IT team. You keep control; we strengthen coverage and visibility where you need it most.",

    {
      q: "What are your SLA targets?",
      a: "We set SLA targets based on business hours and risk. Critical issues get rapid response targets, while standard requests follow agreed same-day/next-day handling—with monthly SLA reporting and continuous improvement.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do you handle onboarding and offboarding?",
      a: "We use checklists: accounts, MFA, device baselines, email/groups, app access, and admin rights. That reduces access mistakes and keeps audits simpler.",

    {
      q: "Do you support Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace environments?",

    {
      q: "How fast can you stabilize a messy environment?",
      a: "Many SMBs see noticeable improvement within the first 30 days once monitoring, patching, baselines, and ticket ownership are in place. Exact timelines depend on device count, tooling, and current risk level.",
